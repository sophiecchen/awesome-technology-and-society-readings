# Awesome Technology and Society Readings [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Motivated by the curated lists awesome-* lists throughout GitHub and by the lack of emphasis on thinking holistically about the societal impact of technology in many computer science university curricula, here's a list of publicly available technology and society readings that I think computer science and security practitioners and students should take a look at.

A big thanks to Dr. Philip Rogaway, who many of these readings have come from and who inspired this collection.
