# Awesome Technology and Society Readings [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Inspired by the curated lists awesome-* lists throughout GitHub and motivated by the lack of emphasis on thinking holistically about the societal impact of technology in many computer science university curricula, here's a list of publicly available technology and society readings that I think computer science and security students should take a look at. To be clear, most of these readings are depressing and very much not awesome. However, I think that as practitioners of technology, we have the moral responsibility to reflect on and understand the worst ways that technology has played out in society, so as to stop us from using our skills to build a world even more inhumane.

The list of readings above is of course non-exhaustive: as technology evolves, new work on the intersection of technology and society continues to be released. Here are some people, labs, and organizations (in no particular order) who have worked on and wrote about the topics listed above.
